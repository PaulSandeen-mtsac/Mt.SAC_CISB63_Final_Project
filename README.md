# Mt.SAC_CISB63_Final_Project
A wiki (pronounced “WIK-ee”) is an Internet website containing information created and maintained by its readership community. The website wikiHow is a knowledge base that contains “how-to” information on a wide variety of topics including Hobbies and Crafts, Pets and Animals, Philosophy and Religion, Relationships, and Health. The goal of wikiHow is to allow readers to acquire new skills by reading articles with step-by-step illustrated instructions on how to perform various tasks related to topic categories.

The wikiHow Dataset is a large collection of articles from the wikiHow knowledge base saved in a Comma-Separated Value (.csv) file format. There are three columns in the CSV file:

Title: The title of the article on wikiHow.
Headline: The summary of the steps in the step-by-step description.
Text: The body of the article containing step-by-step directions.
This project will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the articles in the wikiHow Dataset to identify related topics and provide summarization of the articles.
